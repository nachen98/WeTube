It is bordered by Colorado to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast. Of the fifty U.S. states, Utah is the 13th-largest by area; with a population over three million, it is the 30th-most-populous and 11th-least-densely populated. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the state, which is home to roughly two-thirds of the population and includes the capital city, Salt Lake City; and Washington County in the south, with more than 170,000 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in the Great Basin.\nMusic has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down. It's always a good idea to listen to some background music while you're doing something. So here are some relaxing piano pieces with 4k nature videos that will help you relax, feel relaxed, and get ready for bed.\n\n\"\ud83c\udfb9More soothing music on Spotify playlist: https://spoti.fi/38bwOia\n\nCredit: \n\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Records:\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Spotify    \n\u27a4 Instagram: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Inst...    \n\u27a4 Facebook: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Face...  \n\u27a4 Tiktok: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Tiktok   \n\u27a4 SoundCloud: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Soun...\n\n\u266a BigRicePiano \u266a\n\u25cf https://spoti.fi/3ysT8zT\n\u25cf https://apple.co/3ww1HZu\n\u25cf https://bigrice.bandcamp.com\n\u25cf https://www.youtube.com/c/BigRicePiano\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Relaxing Space\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3kJuAy3\n\n\ud83c\udf1e For contact and submit music: relax@wondermusic.us\n\n\u25baAll rights belong to their respective owners.\n\u2714 This video was given a special license directly from the artists and the right holders.\n\n",

        "description": "\nFLYING OVER VIETNAM (4K UHD) Amazing Beautiful Nature Scenery & Relaxing Music - 4K Video Ultra HD\n\nVietnam was inhabited as early as the Paleolithic age. The first known Vietnamese nation during the first millennium BC centred on the Red River Delta, located in modern-day northern Vietnam. The Han dynasty annexed and put the Vietnamese under Chinese rule from 111 BC, until the first independent dynasty emerged in 939. Successive monarchical dynasties absorbed Chinese influences through Confucianism and Buddhism, and expanded southward to the Mekong Delta. The Nguy\u1ec5n\u2014the last imperial dynasty\u2014fell to French colonisation in 1887. Following the August Revolution, the nationalist Viet Minh under the leadership of communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh proclaimed independence from France in 1945.\n\nVietnam went through prolonged warfare through the 20th century. After World War II, France returned to reclaim colonial power in the First Indochina War, from which Vietnam emerged victorious in 1954. The Vietnam War began shortly after, during which the nation was divided into communist North supported by the Soviet Union and China, and anti-communist South supported by the United States. Upon North Vietnamese victory in 1975, Vietnam reunified as a unitary socialist state under the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1976. An ineffective planned economy, trade embargo by the West, and wars with Cambodia and China crippled the country. In 1986, the Communist Party initiated economic and political reforms, transforming the country to a market-oriented economy.\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 More soothing music on Spotify playlist: https://spoti.fi/38bwOia\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Records:\n\u27a4 Spotify Relaxing: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Spot...\n\u27a4 Spotify Concentration: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Spot...\n\u27a4 Instagram: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Inst...\n\u27a4 Facebook: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Face...\n\u27a4 Tiktok: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Tiktok\n\u27a4 SoundCloud: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Soun...\n\n\u266a BigRicePiano \u266a\n\u25cf https://spoti.fi/3ysT8zT\n\u25cf https://apple.co/3ww1HZu\n\u25cf https://bigrice.bandcamp.com\n\u25cf https://www.youtube.com/c/BigRicePiano\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Relaxing Space\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3kJuAy3\n\n\ud83c\udf1e For contact and submit music: relax@wondermusic.us\n\n\u25baAll rights belong to their respective owners.\n\u2714 This video was given a special license directly from the artists and the right holders.\n\n",

        "description": "\nFLYING OVER JAPAN (4K UHD) Amazing Beautiful Nature Scenery with Relaxing Music | 4K VIDEO ULTRA HD\n\nJapan, known as Nihon, Nihon-koku or Nippon (\u65e5\u672c) in Japanese, is a nation of islands in East Asia.\n\nThe \"Land of the Rising Sun\" is a country where the past meets the future. Japanese culture stretches back millennia, yet has also been quick to adopt and create the latest modern fashions and trends.\n\nJapan is often difficult to understand for those educated in the west. It can seem full of contradictions. Many Japanese corporations dominate their industries, yet if you read the financial news it seems like Japan is practically bankrupt. Cities are as modern and high tech as anywhere else, but tumbledown wooden shacks can still be spotted next to glass fronted designer condominiums. Japan has beautiful temples and gardens which are often surrounded by garish signs and ugly buildings. The most acclaimed restaurant in the country, which costs hundreds of dollars for dinner, is a small shop located in a subway station seating less than a dozen people. In the middle of modern skyscrapers you\u2019ll discover sliding wooden doors which lead to traditional chambers with tatami mats, shoji screens, and calligraphy, suitable for traditional tea ceremonies. These juxtapositions can seem perplexing or jarring to those used to the more uniform nature of European and North American cities, but if you let go, and accept the layered aesthetics, you\u2019ll find interesting and surprising places throughout the country.\n\nJapan has often been seen in the West as a land combining tradition and modernity, and many traditional structures and practices are preserved, but modern structures and practices definitely dominate your experience in Japan. Japan was the first Asian country to independently modernize, and the country continues to embrace new technologies and aesthetics, but unlike in many countries, Japan does not feel a particular need to attack or remove older technologies, structures, or practices. New things are mostly just layered beside old things. That\u2019s not to say that Japan embraces the large scale preservation of historical structures or that people generally practice traditional ceremonies, but people generally believe that if a small number of people want to continue on a tradition or preserve a building that they own, they should be allowed to do that. In this way, development mostly happens in a piecemeal fashion, one building at a time, rather than in large redevelopment projects. Many urban blocks evolve to line up dozens of narrow buildings spanning fifty or more years of design history. Clothing styles evolve along a dozen paths at the same time rather than singular mass fashion trends. An individual that embraces a particular subculture and its fashions may alternately conform to vary different norms when working or at home, but there is little sense of conflict between these roles.\n\njapan, japan 4k, japan relaxation film, 4k, japan relaxation, relaxation film, calming music, stress relief, scenic relaxation, 4k video, 4k video 60fps, video 4k, 4k videos, relax 4k, piano, ultra hd, piano music, bgm, background music, focus, soothing relaxation, calm, soothing, music, beautiful piano music, Piano Relax, piano relaxing, relaxing music, nature sounds, japan 4k video, japan island, japan untra hd, japan travel, 4k nature, 4k 60fps hdr\n\n\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Records:\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Spotify    \n\u27a4 Instagram: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Inst...    \n\u27a4 Facebook: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Face...  \n\u27a4 Tiktok: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Tiktok   \n\u27a4 SoundCloud: https://heliosrecords.fanlink.to/Soun...\n\n\u266a BigRicePiano \u266a\n\u25cf https://spoti.fi/3ysT8zT\n\u25cf https://apple.co/3ww1HZu\n\u25cf https://bigrice.bandcamp.com\n\u25cf https://www.youtube.com/c/BigRicePiano\n\n\n\"\ud83c\udf3f Music by Helios Relaxing Space\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3kJuAy3\"\n\n\"\ud83c\udf3f Music by DawRos\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3orD8e4\"\n\n\"\ud83c\udf3f Music by Dee Art\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3CnNPDn\"\n\n\"\ud83c\udf3f Music by Finn\n\u27a4 Spotify: https://spoti.fi/3Cm9QCk\"\n\n\ud83d\udccc Contacts:\n\u25fd relax@wondermusic.us\n\u25fe channel@wondermusic.us\n\n",

        "description": "\nFLYING OVER THE ALPS (4K UHD) - Calming Music With Stunning Beautiful Natural Film For Relaxation\n\nThe Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe. They were formed about 44 million years ago. The Alps fill most of Switzerland and Liechtenstein and extend from France to Slovenia. On the west, the Alps run along the border between France and Italy. The Alps receive a great deal of snow and rain. At high elevations, the snow turns to ice and then flows down to the valleys as glaciers. Sometimes masses of snow rush uncontrolled down the mountainsides. These events, called avalanches, endanger Alpine communities. The clear Alpine lakes are noted for their beauty. Among the most prominent are Lakes Geneva, Constance, Como, and Z\u00fcrich. Up to approximately 1,050 metres of elevation, the climate is classified as oceanic or Cfb under the K\u00f6ppen system. Like much of lowland northern Europe, the summers are mild and the winters are cool, but not cold.\nMusic has so many benefits, and one of them is that it calms your nerves down.

Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.\n\n\u267a SUPPORT FROM SPACE!\n________________________________\n\u00b0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/evilspace\n\u00b0 SpaceDonat: https://www.donationalerts.ru/r/roini...\n\u00b0 Webmoney: R051030772639\n\n\u267a EVIL BUNS:\n________________________________\n\n\u25cf Music from videos.\n\u25cf You become a regular listener of the radio station: EvilspaceFM (24/7)\n\u25cf Access to exclusive content and articles.\n\u25cf New videos, where I talk about everything interesting.

The area is bounded by a triangle with peaks in Miami, Bermuda, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\nProponents of the theory of mysterious disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle area put forward various hypotheses to explain them: from unusual weather phenomena to abductions by aliens or inhabitants of Atlantis. Skeptics, however, argue that the disappearance of ships in the Bermuda Triangle is not more frequent than in other areas of the World Ocean, and explained by natural causes. \n\n\u267a MUSIC: \n________________________________\nhttps://synthwave-radio.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.apple.com/itunes/\nhttps://bleep.com/\nhttps://www.qobuz.com/gb-en/shop\nhttps://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/ca...\n\n\u267a ANIMATION:\n________________________________\n\nmelodysheep: https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep\nJeremy jozwik: https://www.artstation.com/zeuxis_of_...\nEgor Demin: https://www.artstation.com/darth_biomech\nDarth Biomech: https://www.artstation.com/darth_biomech\nFish tree https://www.deviantart.com/fishytree/\nKen York of YD Visual https://www.facebook.com/YDVisual/\nKristiityan Tavkar https://www.miragedereve.com\nChris Holland (Mafic Studios) www.maficstudios.com\nLegionTech Studio https://hades9.com\nKris Holland of Mafic Stufios: www.maficstudios.com\nSergio Boterio https: https://www.artstation.com/sboterod\nBryan Versteeg http://spacehabs.com\nKeith Carson, Jarred Eagley, Udo Schroeter, Mihail Yordanov, \nMisho Yordanov, Pierre Demet.

The observed anomalies suggest a localized concentration of mass millions of times more massive than the Milky Way. However, it is inconveniently obscured by our own Milky Way's galactic plane, lying behind the Zone of Avoidance (ZOA), so that, in visible light wavelengths, the Great Attractor is difficult to observe directly. In fact, it will not be for another hundred million years that Earth will be on the other side of the Milky Way galaxy, allowing us to see past the galactic plane. (The Great Attractor.
